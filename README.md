# Hi, I’m Kaaif 👋

I build things to understand problems — then I improve them until they’re actually useful.

My background is a bit unconventional:  
I started with low-level game development (Pygame), moved into full-stack web development and real client work, and I’m now focused on **AI engineering and model-driven systems**.

---

## 🧠 What I’m focused on now
- Learning how **LLMs and modern ML systems actually work**
- Learning and adapting to this new **AI Assisted Programming** era
- Turning vague problems into **testable, code-backed experiments**
- Strengthening fundamentals: Python, data handling, system design

---

## 🛠️ What I’ve built before
- **Game prototypes** in Pygame  
  - physics-based movement (acceleration, inertia, collision)
  - procedural / infinite world generation
  - entity systems and low-level rendering
- **Full-stack web apps** with Django  
  - e-commerce workflows, admin systems, deployments
- **Computer vision demos**  
  - digit recognition, face detection using OpenCV
- **Real client projects**  
  - shipped websites, iterated based on feedback, learned what *actually* matters to users

Those experiences shaped how I approach AI now:  
*build fast, test early, learn from reality — not assumptions.*

## 🤝 Open to
- Internships or junior roles in AI / ML / Software Engineering 
- Collaborative projects where learning is valued  
- Conversations with builders, not just résumé collectors  

If something here sparks a thought, feel free to reach out.
